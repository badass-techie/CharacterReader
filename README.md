# Handwritten Text Reader

### A simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits

> deep-learning, machine-learning, neural-network, computer-vision, ai, data-science

This neural network was implemented from scratch (no frameworks were used). The training and test data was obtained from [the MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The network was not tested on the same data it trained on.

## Getting Started

- Navigate to bin/ and run HandwrittenTextReader.exe if you are on windows (if you use linux/mac, you'll have to build the source files and run the output).

- Enter the relative path of the image. The program supports bitmap images of 28 by 28 pixels. You can use the images in data/sample-images/

- See magic

## Deploying

Build all .cpp files in the workspace folder. 
```bash
#build with g++

g++ src/*.cpp EASYBMP_1.06/*.cpp -o bin/CharacterReader
```

## Training the neural network

Call train() from src/main.cpp
```C++
int main(){
    train();
    return 0;
}
```
The training process may take a while, as the training set has 60,000 inputs and outputs. Expect favorable results with a learning rate of around 0.8. After only one epoch, the network may classify more than 90% of all its inputs correctly.

## Reading data from a file

After the training process is complete, the program writes the values of all weights and biases to a csv file. You can initialize the neural network with data from a file previously generated by this program. Call test() from src/main.cpp and pass the relative path of the file as an argument.

```C++
int main(){
    test("../data/weights_and_biases.csv");
    return 0;
}
```

## Final thoughts

Almost all aspects of this neural network were implemented from scratch for the sake of learning. As such, it's poorly optimized - you're better off using libraries for certain tasks, such as matrix multiplication.
